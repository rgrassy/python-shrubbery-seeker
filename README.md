# Python Shrubbery Seeker

## Project Description

My project is an interactive, graphical “Cootie Catcher” fortune-telling game inspired by the classic paper toy and Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Players generate random colors, make selections, and receive playful fortunes, all through a step-by-step visual interface with sound effects.

## Technologies Used

I moved development from the Code in Place IDE to PyCharm because the IDE did not support audio. I used Tkinter for graphics and Pygame for sound.

## Experience

A highlight was learning how to place circles and numbers precisely inside triangles, deepening my understanding of GUI geometry. I also experimented with event-driven logic and included a rare “Holy Grail” Easter Egg fortune. Debugging outside the IDE taught me a lot about user interaction and layout.

## Attribution

Sound effects came from Monty Python and The Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, and course clips of Chris and Mehran (taken from lectures).

Recording a demo video was a great way to share my work beyond platform constraints, since audio libraries weren’t available in the Code in Place IDE. I would have preferred to let my section group demo it themselves.
