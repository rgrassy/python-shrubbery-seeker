# Python Shrubbery Seeker

## Project Description

My project is an interactive, graphical “Cootie Catcher” fortune-telling game inspired by the classic paper toy and Monty Python and The Holy Grail, with fun sound effects.

## Technologies Used

I moved development from the Code in Place IDE to PyCharm because the IDE did not support audio. I used Tkinter for graphics and Pygame for sound.

## Experience

One tough part was learning how to place circles and numbers precisely inside triangles, which helped me better understand how to position shapes and numbers in the interface. I also worked on making the program respond to user actions like clicks and selections, and included a rare “Holy Grail” Easter Egg fortune. Debugging helped me understand user interaction and how to arrange the layout effectively.

## Attribution

Sound effects came from Monty Python and The Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, and clips of Code in Place instructors Chris and Mehran (taken from lectures).
